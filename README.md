Notifyr is a revolutionary application designed to enhance user experience by providing real-time discount notifications when passing by food shops. Leveraging geo-fencing technology, Notifyr utilizes precise location tracking to alert users of ongoing discounts or promotions in nearby food establishments. Here's how it works:

Real-Time Alerts: As users move within the vicinity of participating food shops, Notifyr sends real-time alerts to their smartphones, notifying them of ongoing discounts or promotions. These alerts are delivered instantly, providing users with the opportunity to take advantage of exclusive offers.

Seamless Integration: Notifyr seamlessly integrates with the backend infrastructure of participating food shops, allowing for efficient communication and data exchange. This integration ensures that users receive accurate and up-to-date information about available discounts, enhancing their overall shopping experience.

User-Friendly Interface: Notifyr features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate and customize their notification settings. The application's simple design prioritizes usability, ensuring a seamless experience for users of all skill levels.
